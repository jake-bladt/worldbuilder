# Worldbuilder

## Introduction

Worldbuilder is a web application for creating, storing, exporting, and printing the terrain of earthlike worlds. It's largely meant for the use of RPG game masters, fantasy authors, and other people who engage in world-building, but it may also prove useful to xenocartographers in the future.

## Featureset

Worldbuilder will enable users to 

- draw continents on a globe
- draw political divisions on continents
- save those maps to the server for later use
- export those maps to GeoJson and shapefiles
- generate and print maps of arbitrary portions of the globe using a variety of skins

# Worldbuilder

## Introduction

Worldbuilder is a web application for creating, storing, exporting, and printing the terrain of earthlike worlds. It's largely meant for the use of RPG game masters, fantasy authors, and other people who engage in world-building, but it may also prove useful to xenocartographers in the future.

## Featureset

**Worldbuilder 1.0 will enable users to**

- draw continents on a globe
- draw political divisions on continents
- save those maps to the server for later use
- export those maps to GeoJson and shapefiles
- generate and print maps of arbitrary portions of the globe using a variety of skins

**Long-term vision**

The original idea of WorldBuilder was to fill the niche left by world-mapping tools that are, for the most part, just drawing applications. With tools like Campaign Cartographer, the user draws a map and can export or print it. If they want another map of the same region, they draw another map. These are mapmaking tools, not map-building tools.

The core idea is a system of creating fantasy worlds literally from the ground up. Users draw land masses, geographic features, and political boundaries. That information is stored as GIS-style data - the same as real-world maps. That data can then be skinned and exported into visible maps.

Once you have a tool like that, it becomes the anchor of a lot of other features - the ability to create all the way down and attach it to the world's geography, maps over time, integrated world wikis, etc.

# Worldbuilder

## Introduction

Worldbuilder is a web application for creating, storing, exporting, and printing the terrain of earthlike worlds. It's largely meant for the use of RPG game masters, fantasy authors, and other people who engage in world-building, but it may also prove useful to xenocartographers in the future.
